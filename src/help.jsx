  <p>If you are looking for free Kanban software, My Kanban Tool has become the leading free advanced
     Kanban software platform. We give you Kanban not only for task or project management, 
    but you can create separate Kanban boards for client management to manage your leads and deals.
    Kanban for task AND client management. <br></br>  Let’s face it, with the Kanban board interface being so
     simple and intuitive, many people started using  for client management. Except that  any Kanban software
    isn’t. You can use Kanban for project management and you can use Kanban for client management, but they 
    are different. Very different. My Kanban Tool provides both project management, integrate both with
     eachother and add Kanban interface.Time management inside Kanban.<br></br>  <div style={{display:"flex",justifyContent:"center",margin:"20px"}}> <img src="/imgmain.jpeg" style={{width:"80vw"}}/> </div>  <br></br> Another disadvantage of 
     traditional free Kanban software is that it comes without time tracking, time planning, time
      management or time reporting. My kanban Tool has all of those, and they are friends with Kanban.
       You can even track billable hours and invoice clients directly from inside yourKanban boards.
       Task dependencies, supervision and control.<br></br><br></br> My Kanban Tool was the first free Kanban software to 
       have both Kanban and Gantt views. It remains to be the only Kanban software with Efficiency reports
        (showing which percentage of tasks were completed on time without objections). 
        And we have task dependencies available to free Kanban users as well.
